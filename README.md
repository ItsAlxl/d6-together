# d6 Together
A web app for playing [Forged in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/forged-dark) games online.

## Running the Server
You can compile and run your own server from the source code; all you strictly need is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.20 or later). You can get the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/ItsAlxl/d6-together).

Once you have the code, execute the following commands within the project root to start the server.
```sh
# Get dependencies (only needed the first time)
npm install

# Run server
npm start
```
By default, d6 Together uses port 6462. Use your browser to connect to port 6462 of the server (e.g. `localhost:6462`), and you're all set!
